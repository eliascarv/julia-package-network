# Julia Package Network (WIP)

## Steps
1. Download all \*.md files from Julia registred packages: README.md + docs/src/*.md
2. Process *.md files to generate simple *.txt files
3. Data cleaning with regular expressions to remove special symbols
4. Convert each *.txt file in string vectors
5. Training a neural network to generate embeddings
6. Converting each file to an embedding
7. Assigning a final embedding to each package
